      "contents": "\r\nAs climate change increases the frequency and severity of wildfires across California, there is an urgent need for wildfire preparedness and response in Ventura County.\r\nSocially vulnerable communities disproportionately lack access to resources and services to prepare and recover from wildfires. As a result, they have a heightened risk for human suffering and property loss in the event of wildfire.\r\nIn collaboration with the Ventura Fire Safe Council, our project seeks to identify socially vulnerable communities at risk of wildfire and help to develop a Community Wildfire Protection Plan that equitably addresses community needs.\r\nOur project will also contribute to the field of wildfire management by providing a model for local governments to address social vulnerability concerns. It will demonstrate effective methods for developing an accessible wildfire management plan that engages vulnerable communities to reduce local wildfire risk and increase community resilience with implications beyond Ventura County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
