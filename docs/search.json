      "contents": "\r\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires across California, and there is an urgent need for wildfire preparedness and response in Ventura County, California. Simultaneously, historically-excluded communities disproportionately lack access to resources and services to prepare for and recover from wildfires. As a result, they have a heightened risk of human suffering and property loss in the event of wildfire.\r\nIn collaboration with the Ventura Regional Fire Safe Council, our project identified communities most at risk of wildfire impacts in Ventura County and to help inform the update to the Community Wildfire Protection Plan so that it equitably addresses community needs.\r\nWe developed a model that local governments and organizations can utilize to address social equity concerns in the wildfire planning process. Our goal was to demonstrate effective methods for developing an accessible wildfire management plan that engages impacted residents to reduce local wildfire risk and increase community resilience with implications beyond Ventura County.\r\nRead our work plan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We graduated in June of 2022.\r\n\r\nWe partnered with the Ventura Regional Fire Safe Council (VRFSC) to help facilitate the inclusion of communities most at risk of wildfire in the upcoming revision of the Ventura County Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP).\r\nOur project culminated in a report meant to help inform the projects defined in the CWPP revision.\r\nView our report\r\nWatch our final presentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

She is passionate about making fire ecology and wildfire hazard more approachable and better understood by the public and is excited to serve her community by helping to elevate its marginalized voices.\r\n| Linkedin |\r\nYvonne Dinh\r\n\r\nOriginally from the East Coast, Yvonne had little experience with fire hazard before the project but was excited to learn how it plays a role in the daily lives of vulnerable communities. She was especially interested in exploring how spatial science and community learning can be used supplementary in natural hazard decision making.\r\n| Linkedin |\r\nIris Foxfoot\r\n\r\nOriginally from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Iris spent the three years prior to grad school investigating how wildfire, drought, and climate change impact forest biodiversity in the Sierras. She was thrilled to join this project and to amplify local voices in the wildfire planning process.\r\n| Linkedin |\r\nElena Ortiz\r\n\r\nAs a recent transplant to the Central Coast, Elena was excited to be working on a project that allowed her to deeply engage with and get to know the community. She is passionate about making the environmental decision-making and planning process more equitable, and believes this project can have that kind of lasting impact in Ventura County.\r\n| Linkedin |\r\nAlison Sells\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Southern California, Alison grew up in close proximity to fires and was excited to learn more about the specific needs of vulnerable populations in Ventura County. She interned directly with VRFSC and helped connect with key organizations that support and represent these communities to ensure that all voices are heard in environmental decision making.\r\n| Linkedin |\r\nAdvisory Board\r\nOur internal advisory team included Dr. Sarah Anderson and PhD. student Louis Graup.\r\nOur external advisors were Kate Furlong and Elaine Himmelfarb (Ventura Regional Fire Safe Council), Dr. Max Moritz (UCSB affiliate), Celine Moomey (Ventura County Fire Department).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
